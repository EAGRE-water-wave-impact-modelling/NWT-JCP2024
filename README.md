## About
Revisit the [3D wave tank test cases (TCs)](https://github.com/EAGRE-water-wave-impact-modelling/3D-wave-tank-JCP2022) through the "VP approach" where the weak formulations can be generated automatically given the time-discretised VP.

## Instructions
- Main file: `3D_tank_VP.py`
- Setting of TCn: `settings_TCn.py`

## Updates (8 Nov 2023)
### To do:
- Evaluate the functions when the wavemaker stops
- Output into files
